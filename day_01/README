Notes:

Solution 2 (second part) is written pretty lazily.  Can be cleaned up a bit, and both
scan functions could be combined to one.

This one was tricky.  Multiple attempts at the send part until it was realized that 
you really needed to work backwards on the line based on how the numbers were 
actually parsed.
